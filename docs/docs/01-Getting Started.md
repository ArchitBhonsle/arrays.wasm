The goal of this project is to provide a **fast, easy-to-use linear algebra
Javascript library** powered by WebAssembly, written in Rust.

This project is a part of a larger project called [wasml](https://www.github.com/wasml),
which aims to provide a complete machine learning ecosystem in JavaScript.

:::warning Proper error handling not implemented yet

If you are familiar with Rust, currently all the functions just "panic". This
will be fixed in the future.
