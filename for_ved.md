# General

- [ ] vectors to matrices and vice versa (using into_dimensionality)
- [ ] fill
- [ ] fold
- [ ] add, sub, mul, div, dot between vectors and matrices

# Matrices

- [x] iteration methods over rows and columns (using axis_iter)
- [ ] fold_axis
- [ ] diag (and set diag?)
- [ ] reshape (using to_shape)
- [ ] constructors
  - [ ] eye
  - [ ] all the constructors for one dimensional arrays adapated for 2d with **same names**
    - [ ] from_elem
    - [ ] zeros
    - [ ] ones
    - [ ] from_simple_shape_fn
    - [ ] from_shape_fn

# Improvements

- [ ] improvements to basic methods cause I forgot about push_row, push_column, push and append
